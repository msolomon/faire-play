Man-at-arms - Alexander

Thine name is Alexander, a soldier on leave. Thou hast chosen to grace a nearby country faire with thy presence in search of drink, women, and work--each in equal measure. The King's nearby army at Dunhurst released you for a week's leave two nights ago, and thou'st been traveling to this faire since.

...Yet in truth, that's no truth. You're no soldier--you're an outlaw. To be sure, you've exchanged honest fighting for coin, but more often you've taken lives and coin together: gold, fun, and freedom trounce even drink and slaughter.

Unfortunately, thou mayest have robbed the wrong passer-by. Just yesterday morn you took a hefty gold pouch and a fine black steed at swordpoint from an unsuspecting lone traveler not so far from the army encampment at Dunhurst--all seemed well until thine well-attuned ears heard tell of a noble asking uncomfortable questions in a country inn about a man of your stature riding a midnight horse. You hastily unburdened yourself of the stallion in exchange for some magically enchanted beans (so swore the traveler), yet now you're back on foot.

Now if you could simply get a horse of a different color, stay beneath notice of the law, and have a few drinks along the way without emptying your coin purse--why, surely the next town along it'll all be different. To the future!
