# Earl - Earl von Chandler

Milord Earl von Chandler, the lasses and lads alike of the world turn their heads hear the clinking weight of your fine velvet coinpurses as they overfloweth with coin. Carefree and generous, you dazzle with your expensive and audacious impulsive wagers as easily as thou doth enthrall local nobility with thine extravagant parties. This well-renowned harvest faire is sure to offer opportunities aplenty!

Or at least, that's the image you portray. In truth, thou art broke. With your cunning and head for numbers, you've arranged a series of mortgages on thine estates against each other to pay for ever-mounting gambling debt, but you're all out of tricks. Your debts are to the mysterious and vicious crime lord known as The Mantis, who will have your hide if they find out you can't pay. You need to win it all back, soon.

You fear the local fortune teller may unravel your web of debt--perhaps thou mayest silence the seer here at the festival during a private consultation, to buy more time.

The Mantis also may come seeking payment. Thou hast enough, but only just. Perhaps thou couldst increase it with your skills....
