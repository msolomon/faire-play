Alchemist - Tonks

The finest elixirs, magical devices, and solvents in the Northern Kingdom--you, Tonks, travel far and wide to peddle your wondrous brews and to visit the furthest corners of the world! This quaint county faire is no less deserving than the rest.

...at least, that's your traveling persona. In truth, you are a master thief hiding in plain sight. Your alchemical knowledge comes from skills honed in pickpocketing and burglary, and your money comes from unwitting victims.

Unfortunately, you've had some close calls recently. You had to leave a luxurious life behind in a hurry, and lost all your earnings in the process. Then you lost your alchemical ingredients, accidentally witnessed the murder of an unknown man, and your good friend Priestess Penelope got kidnapped.

If you can get your friend Penelope back, a fresh pouch full of gold, and stay out of trouble, then maybe you can finally get a new start. Is that so much to ask of a world-class thief?
